## Collaborating with Doctors

- A few years ago, I collaborated with (medical) doctors studying uterine fibroids (myomas).

## Comparing Medical Procedures

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Doctors compared two minimally invasive treatments for myomas to determine which:

1. **Is more effective at reducing fibroid size**.
2. **Is less invasive for patients**, measured by shorter hospital stays, lower blood loss, etc.

**Procedures Compared:**

- **Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA)**
- **Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE)**
:::

## Doctors' Initial Expectations

Doctors initially expected **RFA** to outperform the alternative treatment:

- More effective at reducing myoma size.
- Less invasive, resulting in shorter hospital stays and quicker recovery.

**Biased toward RFA!**


---

## Disappointing Results...

Statistical analysis revealed **no significant differences** between RFA and the alternative treatment regarding length of hospital stay.

**Data did not support the doctors' initial preference for RFA!**

---


## A "Statistical Adjustment" Suggestion

One doctor asked:

*"Can we perform a statistical adjustment to make RFA look better?"*

::: {.fragment}
And I replied

*"What do you mean by 'statistical adjustment'?"*
:::

::: {.fragment}
Doctor:

*"Look, if we remove this patient with an unusually large myoma from the RFA group, the results become significant!"*
:::

---

## Wait... Can We Do That?

- This is not how stats work!
- But this inspired a deeper question:

> How can one systematically select a minimal subset of data points to manipulate in order to alter a statistical conclusion?

---

## Background

- In this project, we explore this question specifically within the context of **Bayesian inference** (aka **Probabilistic Machine Learning**).

- Adversarial Machine Learning (AML), studies how data manipulations influence machine learning models.

- However, there is a gap in the literature regarding **adversarial attacks** on Bayesian inference.

- The types of  attacks we consider involve manipulations of the training set and are known as **poisoning attacks**.

--- 

## The Problem

- **Honest Bayesian** (Defender) observes data $\mathbf{X}$.
- Goal: infer unknown parameters $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^d$.

Posterior contains all relevant inferential information:
$$
\pi(\theta | \mathbf{X}) \propto \exp\Big(\textstyle\sum_{i=1}^n \log \pi(X_i | \theta)\Big) \pi(\theta)
$$

- Posterior **informs critical decisions** such as medical treatments or economic policy.
- Typically computed via approximation (e.g., MCMC).


---

## Example: Mexico Microcredit Data

- Randomized controlled trial on microcredit (16,560 businesses) conducted in Mexico City (Angelucci et al., 2015).
- Treatment assignment: 
$$
x_i =
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{microcredit} \\
0 & \text{control}
\end{cases}
$$

:::{.fragment}
- Objective: Assess impact on business profit $y_i$.
:::

---

## Example: Mexico Microcredit Data

**Model used**:
$$
y_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i, \sigma^2)
$$

:::{.fragment}
**Priors**:
$$
\beta_0,\,\beta_1,\, \log(\sigma) \sim t(3,\,0,\,1000)
$$
:::

:::{.fragment}
- Parameter $\beta_1$ represents the **Average Treatment Effect (ATE)**.
:::
---

## Posterior for the ATE



<div class="centered-figure">
  <img src="images/posterior_treatment_effect.jpeg" alt="My Image" style="max-width: 70%;">
</div>

- Posterior mean of ATE ($\beta_1$): $-4.71$ (negative impact).
- Potential policy implication: **Do not expand microcredit.**

---

## The Sneaky Doctor

- **Attacker** manipulates data by deleting or replicating points.

- Represented by integer vector $w \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}^n$:
  - $w_i = 0$: remove data point $i$
  - $w_i > 1$: replicate data point $i$
  - $w_i = 1$: no change

---

## The Sneaky Doctor

- Resulting posterior (**w-induced posterior**):
$$
\pi_w(\theta | \mathbf{X}) = \frac{1}{Z(w)} \exp\left(\sum_{i=1}^n w_i \log \pi(X_i|\theta)\right) \pi(\theta)
$$

- Goal: alter statistical conclusions by manipulating just a few data points.

---

## The Attack

Just removing a **strategically chosen** $0.12 \%$ of the  data points...

## Formalizing the Adversary's Problem

<br>
<br>
<br>
**Goal:** Find **minimal** data manipulations $w \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}^n$ such that the resulting posterior $\pi_w(\theta | \mathbf{X})$ is **as close as possible** to a target distribution $\pi_A(\theta)$.


---

## Formalizing the Adversary's Problem

Minimize forward KL divergence:
$$
\min_w \quad \text{KL}(\pi_A(\theta) \parallel \pi_w(\theta | X))
$$

Subject to constraints:
$$
\|w - \mathbf{1}\|_1 \leq B, \quad \|w\|_\infty \leq L, \quad w \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}^n
$$

---

## But...

- Exact posterior often intractable (unknown normalization constant).
- There is no closed-form expression for the objective function.
- **Integrality constraints** further complicate the optimization problem.


## Idea




- Solve the continuous relaxation first using **projected stochastic gradient-based optimization**. 

- Then, project the solution to the integer space.

:::{.fragment}
- Equivalent simplified objective:
$$
-w^\top \mathbb{E}_{\pi_A(\theta)}[f_X(\theta)] + \log Z(w)
$$
where $f_X(\theta) = \log \pi(X|\theta)$ and $\log Z(w)$ is the log of the normalization constant.
:::

---

## Estimating the Gradient

- The gradient of the objective is:

$$
\nabla_w \log Z(w) - \mathbb{E}_{\pi_A}[f_X(\theta)]
$$

:::{.fragment}
- But $\log Z(w)$ is intractable...
::: 

---

## Estimating the Gradient - Main Trick!


- Notice posterior $\pi_w(\theta | X)$ constitutes a **subset of an exponential family** with parameter $w$ and log-partition function $\log Z(w)$. Then:

$$
\nabla_w \log Z(w) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi_w}[f_X(\theta)]
$$

:::{.fragment}
- Thus, the gradient simplifies to:

$$
\nabla_w \log Z(w) - \mathbb{E}_{\pi_A}[f_X(\theta)] = \mathbb{E}_{\pi_w}[f_X(\theta)] - \mathbb{E}_{\pi_A}[f_X(\theta)]
$$
:::
---

## Convexity and Hessian

- Moreover, the Hessian of the objective is:

$$
\nabla^2_w \log Z(w) = \text{Cov}_{\pi_w}(f_X(\theta), f_X(\theta)) \succeq 0
$$

:::{.fragment}
- Hessian is positive semidefinite:
  - Objective function is **convex** (relaxed).
  - Convergence results from stochastic gradient descent apply!
:::

---

## Solution Approaches: Main Idea

We use a two-stage heuristic (SGD-R2):

1. **Relaxation**: Solve continuous relaxation via projected stochastic gradient methods.

:::{.fragment}
2. **Rounding step**: Project the relaxed solution onto the integer feasible set.
:::
---

## SGD Rounded Relaxation (SGD-R2)

- At each step, use stochastic gradient descent updates:
  
$$
w_{\text{new}} \gets \Pi_{\mathcal{W}}\left(w_{\text{old}} - \gamma_t \hat{g}\right)
$$

where $\Pi_{\mathcal{W}}$ is the projection operator onto the feasible set

$$
\mathcal{W} = \{w \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid w \succeq 0,\, \|w\|_{\infty}\le L,\; \|w - \mathbf{1}\|_1 \leq B\}
$$

:::{.fragment}
- Recall that the gradient could be expressed as:
$$
\mathbb{E}_{\pi_w}[f_X(\theta)] - \mathbb{E}_{\pi_A}[f_X(\theta)]
$$
:::
---

## SGD-R2: Gradient Estimation


- Unbiased gradient estimate:

$$
\hat{g} = \frac{1}{P}\sum_{i=1}^P f_X(\theta_i) - \frac{1}{Q}\sum_{j=1}^Q f_X(\theta_j)
$$

- With samples: $\theta_i \sim \pi_w(\theta|\mathbf{X})$ and $\theta_j \sim \pi_A(\theta)$

:::{.fragment}
- Interestingly, **we do not need a closed-form expressions** for neither the posterior nor the target distribution!
:::

---

## Rounding to an Integer Solution

Solve constrained rounding problem to find integer feasible solution $w^*$ close to relaxed solution:

$$
w^* = \arg\min_{w' \in \mathcal{W}\cap\mathbb{Z}^n_{\geq 0}} \|w'-w\|^2_2
$$

:::{.fragment}
- **Optimal rounding solution** exists in closed form: 

$$
w^*_i = 1 + \text{sign}(w_i - 1)(\lfloor |w_i - 1| \rfloor + \alpha_i)
$$
:::

---

## Variants for Improved Efficiency

- **Adam-R2:** Use Adam optimizer, scales gradients, faster practical convergence.

- Second-order methods (2O-R2): Exploit Hessian information.



---

## Computational considerations

- Estimating gradients might require MCMC sampling.
- However, gradual changes in $w$ allow reuse of previous MCMC samples, reducing burn-in and computational overhead.

## Back to the Mexico Microcredit data

Assume we have resources to manipulate at most $B=20$ data points (just $0.12\%$ of the data!).

## A more complex model

Infer parameters of a linear model for predicting housing prices from house characteristics (Boston Housing dataset):

$$
y_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\alpha + x_i^\top \beta,\,\sigma^2), \quad i=1,\dots,n
$$

- $y_i$: Median house price (MEDV).
- $x_i$: Covariates (e.g., number of rooms, age of building, etc).
- Dataset size: $n=404$, with $d=13$ covariates.

---

## A more complex model

* Model chosen by the **Honest Bayesian**:  
Linear model with sparsity-inducing Horseshoe prior on parameters (MCMC for inference).

:::{.fragment}
* **Adversary's** goal: 
Manipulate data to steer inference about the parameter of the number of rooms ($\beta_{RM}$) toward 0.

## A couple of alternative heuristics

- Interger-Steps Coordinate Descent (ISCD):
  - At each iteration, consider feasible neighbors $w \pm e_i$.
  - Update neighbor with best estimated improvement:

- Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM):
  - Commonly used in adversarial ML literature (Goodfellow et al., 2014).
  - Estimate gradient once, manipulate $B$ points with highest gradient magnitudes.



---

## Integer-Steps Coordinate Descent 

- Start with initial feasible $w = \mathbf{1}$.
- At each iteration, consider feasible neighbors $w \pm e_i$.
- Select neighbor with best estimated improvement:
$$
j \gets \argmin_i \left\{-|\hat{g}_i|+\frac{1}{2}\hat{H}_{i,i}\right\}
$$

- Update:
$$
w \gets w - \text{sign}(\hat{g}_j)e_j
$$


---

## Baseline Attack: FGSM

- Commonly used in adversarial ML literature (Goodfellow et al., 2014).
- Adapted here to use stochastic gradients.

1. Initialize $w = \mathbf{1}$.
2. Compute gradient estimate $\hat{g}$ once.
3. Select $B$ points with highest gradient magnitudes.
4. Update selected points:
$$
w_i \gets w_i - \text{sign}(\hat{g}_i)
$$
