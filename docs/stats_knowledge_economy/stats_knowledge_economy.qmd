## Knowledge Economy

"Economic system in which the production of goods and services is based principally on **knowledge-intensive activities** that contribute to advancement in technical and scientific innovation."

## Knowledge Economy and Statistics

Statistics is (essentially) the discipline that turns data into knowledge.

<br>

> **If statistics is about extracting knowledge from data, then the knowledge economy is our natural home‚Äîbut are we living up to that role?**

##  The Shift in Drivers of Statistics

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="50%"}

**Tradition ‚Äì Science as driver**

* Domains: astronomy, genetics, medicine.
* Goal: **diffuse and evolving** ‚Üí to generate knowledge, explain phenomena, refine theories.

::::

:::: {.column width="50%"}

**Today ‚Äì Industry as driver**

* Domains: tech, advertising, e-commerce, autonomous systems.
* Goal: **explicit and measurable** ‚Üí maximize profit.

  * Proxy goals: engagement, retention, clicks, subscriptions, etc.

:::: 
:::

---

## Key Differences in Goals

* Scientific goals are **open-ended** and hard to pin down.
* Industrial goals are **singular and concrete** (money).

## The Problematic Disconnect

* The tradition within statistics **hasn‚Äôt adapted (yet) to new drivers**.

* Not saying that statisticians should abandon scientific goals.

  * If you are doing **purely theoretical work**, that‚Äôs "fine"...
  * If you are **working for science**, that‚Äôs "fine"...
  * But there is a **subset of statisticians in academia working on industrial problems that are completely disconnected from practice!**

---

## Causes of the Disconnect

* Lack of deep **connection with industry**.

* Lack of **clear metrics** to optimize.

* Not enough emphasis on **scalability**.

* Not enough emphasis on **open-source software** and **open science**.

* A publishing system that (sometimes) **values elegance over effectiveness**.

* A **slow, peer-reviewed journal** system that is out of sync with industry timelines.

* ...

---

## Online Controlled Experiments

* Airbnb, Netflix... run **thousands of A/B tests daily**.
* Goal: maximize engagement and revenue.
* Needs: automation, reliable metrics, scalable experimentation platforms.
* Experiments are directly tied to **business objectives**.

<div class="centered-figure">
  <img src="images/ab.jpeg" alt="Follow the Money" style="max-width: 40%;">
</div>

---

## Statistical Challenges

* Traditionally: small, clean trials in agriculture, medicine, psychology.

**Today (industry-driven challenges):**

* Many experiments running in parallel ‚Üí interference.
* Millions of users ‚Üí scalability.
* Real-time sequential testing and monitoring.
* Messy data: noncompliance, missingness ...
* ...


---

## Large Language Models (LLMs)

* Foundation of today‚Äôs ~~knowledge~~ intelligence economy.
* Used for search, chatbots, copilots, content generation.
* Progress is driven by **scale and benchmarks**.
* "Alignment with human preferences".
* Key issues: reliability, hallucination, robustness, evaluation.

## Statistical Challenges

* Statistical NLP tradition: small corpora, hand-crafted features, likelihood-based inference.
* Today: trillion-parameter models, data not iid, distribution shifts.
* **Challenge for statisticians:**

  * Quantify (and define) uncertainty in outputs.
  * Develop robustness methods (adversarial + distributional).
  * ...

---

## Autonomous Driving

* Safety-critical AI system with massive societal impact.
* Combines sensors, perception, prediction, decision-making.
* Needs: **real-time performance, reliability, robustness**.
* Failures have catastrophic consequences.

## Statistical Challenges

* Deep learning perception + massive simulation environments.

* **Challenge for statisticians:**

  * Inference at scale (likelihood-free).
  * Robustness to distribution shifts and attacks.
  * Safety guarantees under uncertainty.
  * ...

---


## Computational Advertising

* Multi-billion-dollar industry: **ad auctions, targeting, personalization**.
* Decisions in **milliseconds** across billions of users.
* Goal: maximize clicks, conversions, and revenue.
* Research is **metrics-driven**: CTR, auction efficiency.

---

## New Statistical Challenges

* Traditional discrete-choice / survey models don‚Äôt scale.
* Adversarial setting: agents manipulate bids, users game the system.
* Need causal inference at scale: bias correction for targeting.
* Inference under *strategic behavior* and *non-iid data*.

---

## Common Threads Across Domains

* Research is driven by **clear metrics** and **scalability** to massive datasets.

* **Real-time decisions** require **fast, robust methods**‚Äîoften without tractable likelihoods.

* The world changes fast: **distribution shifts** and **non-iid data** are the norm.

  * Happens in OCE (interventional shifts), LLMs (adversarial prompts), ADS (adversarial image manipulation).

* **Robustness** and **adaptability** are essential for modern statistical practice.

## Statistical challenges

* Inference methods **scalable to massive data**.
* Fast inference for **real-time decisions**.
* **Likelihood-free** inference.
* Robustness to **distribution shifts**.
* Robustness to **adversarial attacks**.
* Causal inference under **interference**.

## To sum up...


<div class="centered-figure">
  <img src="images/bob.jpg" alt="bob" style="max-width: 15%;">
</div>

* Specially true in statistics, where the **drivers of research** have shifted **from science to industry**.

* Many statisticians in academia working on industrial problems are **disconnected from practice**.

* We need to adapt our methods and mindset to address the challenges of the **~~knowledge~~ intelligence economy**.


---

## Moving Forward: Learning from CS

* Metrics-driven research: benchmarks and leaderboards.

* Conference system: faster iteration, closer to industry timelines.

* Software & reproducibility: code is a first-class research output.

* Think in more dimensions: scalability, robustness, latency, interpretability.

This creates a stronger ecosystem between academia and industry.

## Moving Forward

> We don't have to become computer scientists (please!), but rather take inspiration from their practices to make our research more relevant.
